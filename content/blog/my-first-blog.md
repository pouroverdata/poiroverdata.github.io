"Where coffee meets data!" 





Welcome to Pour Over Data, a website dedicated to exploring the intersection of data science, bioinformatics, and machine learning using coffee-related datasets and beyond. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or simply interested in the latest developments in data science, you'll find something of interest here. My goal is to provide a unique perspective on data analysis and machine learning by applying these techniques to coffee-related datasets, as well as other datasets in the field of agriculture, biology and genetics. You can expect to find blog posts, tutorials, and resources on a wide range of topics including data analysis, machine learning, bioinformatics, and more. So, grab a cup of coffee and join me as I dive into the world of data science and coffee.
