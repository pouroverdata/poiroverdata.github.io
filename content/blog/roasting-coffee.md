Coffee roasting is the process of heating green coffee beans in order to convert them into the dark, flavorful, and aromatic roasted coffee beans that we use to make coffee. There are various types of coffee roasters, including drum roasters, air roasters, and fluid bed roasters.

Before the invention of coffee roasters, early adopters of coffee were roasting their coffee using various methods. One of the most common methods was using a skillet or pan on an open flame. This method, also known as "**pan roasting**," involved continually stirring the green coffee beans in a skillet over a heat source until they reached the desired level of roast. This method was labor-intensive and required a skilled hand to achieve a consistent roast. Another method used was to roast the coffee beans in an oven, by spreading the green coffee beans on a baking sheet and placing them in the oven. This method, also known as "**oven roasting**," was less labor-intensive than pan roasting, but it was also less precise and required careful monitoring to prevent burning the beans. A third method was to roast the coffee beans on a bed of hot coals, which was common in places where coffee was grown, like Ethiopia. This method, also known as "**bed roasting**," was similar to pan roasting, but it was more efficient and less labor-intensive as the beans were spread out over a large area and were roasted uniformly. These traditional methods were used for centuries before the invention of modern coffee roasters, which made the process more efficient, consistent, and precise.

The first coffee roasters were invented in the late 19th century and were typically powered by steam or gas. Today, most commercial coffee roasters use electric power. The specific time and temperature for roasting coffee can vary depending on the desired flavor profile, but generally, light roasts are roasted for a shorter amount of time at a lower temperature, while dark roasts are roasted for a longer amount of time at a higher temperature. For example, a light roast may be roasted for around 7-9 minutes at a temperature of around 400°F, while a dark roast may be roasted for around 12-15 minutes at a temperature of around 460°F. 

Some of the coffee strains that are suitable for dark roast are robusta, while Arabicas are suitable for a light roast. Additionally, coffee grown in specific geographic regions such as Ethiopia, Colombia, and Kenya are often considered to be of high quality and are suitable for both light and dark roasts.
