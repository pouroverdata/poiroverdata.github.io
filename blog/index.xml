Welcome to Pour Over Data, a website dedicated to exploring the intersection of data science, bioinformatics, and machine learning using coffee-related datasets and beyond. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a coffee aficionado or simply interested in the latest developments in data science, you&amp;rsquo;ll find something of interest here. My goal is to provide a unique perspective on data analysis and machine learning by applying these techniques to coffee-related datasets, as well as other datasets in the field of agriculture, biology and genetics.</description></item></channel></rss>
