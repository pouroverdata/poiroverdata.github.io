There have been a number of sequencing studies that have been conducted on coffee species, primarily on Coffea canephora (robusta) and Coffea arabica (arabica), which are the two most widely cultivated species of coffee.
In 2010, the first draft genome of Coffea canephora was published by an international consortium led by the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD). The genome assembly consisted of 36,336 scaffolds and its size was estimated at around 940 Mb. The genome assembly was based on a robusta cultivar, and it was found to have a higher number of genes than other plant genomes of its size.

In 2014, the first high-quality reference genome of Coffea arabica was published. The genome was assembled using a combination of Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, and it was found to have a similar gene content as the robusta genome but with a smaller genome size of around 730 Mb.

In 2018, the first genome of Coffea liberica was published, showing a clear divergence from the genomes of C. arabica and C. canephora.
These studies and others have provided a wealth of genetic information about coffee species that can be used for understanding the genetic basis of important traits such as caffeine content, disease resistance, and fruit development, as well as for improving breeding and crop management.Also, more recent studies have been focused in transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis of different coffee species, cultivars and tissue under different conditions, such as abiotic stress, and disease resistance.
